title: The Scientist Guitar Song Practices
---

In this post, I record my guitar journey practicing the coldplay's song called The Scientist Guitar.

I pretty love this song, which will express my feelings and love to someone who has gone.

I hope God can take me back to the start when we met.

But I know it is impossible. 

Just want to write down this loving experience, which can't be taken back.
